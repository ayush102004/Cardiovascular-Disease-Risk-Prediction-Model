# Cardiovascular-Disease-Risk-Prediction-Model
Objective of the Project:
The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model for cardiovascular disease risk and provide data-driven insights to improve early detection and prevention strategies.The specific objectives are:
  ● To collect and analyze comprehensive health data related to cardiovascular diseases.
  ● To identify key risk factors associated with cardiovascular diseases.
  ● To develop and validate predictive models for cardiovascular disease risk.
  ● To propose targeted interventions and prevention strategies based on the model's findings..
  ● To assess the potential impact of these interventions on reducing CVD incidence and mortality.
  ● To align the project outcomes with SDG 3 objectives.
